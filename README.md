# BlueOS ROS2 Extension

This extension makes it possible to communicate with the vehicle via [ROS2](https://github.com/ros2).

## Updating the extension
This repository is responsible for packaging our pi code into a Docker image that will be run as a BlueOS extension. This repo contains the rov-26 repo as a git submodule, which just means it is a directory inside this repo that is tracked separately by git. Whenever you make a change to the rov-26 repo and want to build a new version of the extension, you need to update submodule in this repo. Every day dependabot (a github bot) will check for submodule updates and make a pull request if it finds one, but if you want to build a new version of the extension before dependabot gets around to it, you will need to update the submodule manually. After cloning the repo, run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`. After the initial clone, you should only have to run `git submodule update`, commit the change, and `git push` every time you want to update. After you push to the main brach, a CI action will automatically build a docker image (using the commands in Dockerfile) and upload it to our dockerhub account at https://hub.docker.com/repositories/cwrubotixmaterov. The new docker image can then be downloaded onto the Navigator (setup instructions in the rov-26 pi_main readme). To update our custom extension, just go to the extension page on the BlueOS web dashboard, go to the installed tab, edit the CWRUbotix extension, and hit save (without actually changing anything).
